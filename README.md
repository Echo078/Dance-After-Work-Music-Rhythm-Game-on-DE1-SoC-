# Dance-After-Work-Music-Rhythm-Game-on-DE1-SoC-
This is an audio-visiual integrated project based on DE1-SoC FPGA board in Verilog (Assembly language). Our idea for our project is a musical rhythm game inspired by Osu!, where animated hit circles are generated by the beat of a pre-selected song and the player must click on the hit circles in time with the beat.
